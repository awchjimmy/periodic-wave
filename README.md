Stablecoin arbitrage

### What is Stablecoin Arbitrage?
Stablecoin arbitrage involves finding stablecoin trading pairs, such as USDC/USDT or DAI/USDT. You buy at $1.0000 and sell at $1.0001, capturing a spread of $0.0001.

### Why Choose Stablecoins?
Stablecoins are preferred because their prices are designed to return to a 1:1 peg, minimizing the risk of significant price deviations that might not revert. This stability reduces risk, it also means lower returns, requiring time to accumulate meaningful profits.

### Transaction Fees?
Find trading pairs with low or zero transaction fees, so fees don't eat up your profits.
